            <br />
            <p>
              This project was developed as part of my final semester thesis. The system is designed to provide remote monitoring and control of home electronic devices using an internet-connected platform. The components used in this
              project include:
            </p>
            <br />
            <ol class="list-decimal list-inside">
              <li>NodeMCU (ESP8266)</li>
              <li>DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor</li>
              <li>Relay Module</li>
              <li>Servo Motor</li>

              <li>Various connecting wires</li>
              <li>A custom-built mobile application developed using Kodular</li>
            </ol>
            <br />
            <p>The main purpose of this system is to assist homeowners when they are away, such as traveling out of town, and are unable to manually control the lighting or electronic appliances at home.</p>
            <p>
              <br />
              This smart home system allows users to remotely control and monitor household electronic devices via an internet connection. With real-time communication powered by Google Firebase, homeowners can manage their home appliances
              from anywhere, without needing to return home or rely on neighbors for help.

    desc: `<p>
            This project is a <strong>Music Streaming Web Application</strong> built with
            <strong>React.js</strong>. It provides an interactive interface that allows users to explore music charts,
            listen to featured tracks, and browse playlists and podcasts.
          </p>

          <p>
            The application uses <strong>local API data</strong> as its source for songs, albums, and playlists.
            It implements <strong>React state management</strong> with <strong>useContext</strong> to handle global
            states such as the currently playing track, playback controls, and playlist management.
          </p>
          </br>

          <h3>Key Features:</h3>
          <ol class='list-decimal list-inside'>
            <li><strong>Featured Charts &amp; Playlists</strong>: Showcasing top charts, trending songs, and curated mixes.</li>
            <li><strong>Now Playing Bar</strong>: Displaying the current track with playback controls.</li>
            <li><strong>State Management</strong>: Centralized state using React Context API for consistent playback and navigation.</li>
          </ol>
          </br>

          <p>
            This project demonstrates how React.js can be used to build a modern, dynamic, and user-friendly
            music streaming interface similar to popular platforms.
